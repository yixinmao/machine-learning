## Relevant Reviews of Machine Learning Applications in Water Resources Research

- [Shen (2018): A transdisciplinary review of deep learning research and its relevance for water resources scientists, Water Resources Researh.](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2018WR022643)

- [Raghavendra and Deka (2014): Support vector machine applications in the field of hydrology: A review, Applied Soft Computing.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568494614000611#!)

- [Yaseen et al. (2015): Artificial intelligence based models for stream-flow forecasting: 2000â€“2015, Journal of Hydrology.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022169415008069#!)

- And many more researches, and you may be contributing to the future ones!

## Computer Vision

1. [opencv](https://opencv.org)


## Support Vector Machine/Random Forest/etc.

1. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
1. [vowpal wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)
1. [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)


## Deep Learning

1. [AWS Deep learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/)
1. [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org)
1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
1. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org)
1. [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (python Torch)
1. [Keras](https://keras.io) (api for python that plays with TensorFlow, Theano, and others)


## ESRI + QGIS

Machine learning capabilities exist in both ESRI & QGIS (support vector machine), however for scaling to large image sets, opensource scripting is nicely adaptable.

## Mapbox & Development Seed
(super cool geospatial companies with international offices)
1. [Mapbox on github](https://github.com/mapbox): they have some awesome tutorials ad open source tools to check out
1. [DevSeed onn github](https://github.com/developmentseed): Related to Mapbox, they do a lot of GIS Deep Learning
1. [robosat](https://github.com/mapbox/robosat)
1. [training data from OSM](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker)
