# Machine Learning Resources

## Computer Vision

1. [opencv](https://opencv.org)

## Support Vector Machine/Random Forest/etc

1. [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
1. [vowpal wabbit](https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit/wiki)
1. [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Deep Learning

1. [AWS Deep learning AMI](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/amis/)
1. [MXNet](https://mxnet.apache.org)
1. [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
1. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org)
1. [pyTorch](https://pytorch.org) (python Torch)
1. [Keras](https://keras.io) (api for python that plays with TensorFlow, Theano, and others)

## ESRI + QGIS

Machine learning capabilities exist in both ESRI & QGIS (support vector machine), however for scaling to large image sets, opensource scripting is nicely adaptable.

## Mapbox & Development Seed
(super cool geospatial companies with international offices)
1. [Mapbox on github](https://github.com/mapbox): they have some awesome tutorials ad open source tools to check out
1. [DevSeed onn github](https://github.com/developmentseed): Related to Mapbox, they do a lot of GIS Deep Learning
1. [robosat](https://github.com/mapbox/robosat)
1. [training data from OSM](https://github.com/developmentseed/label-maker)

## Basic Discussion of Learning

1. [Gradient Descent & Cost/Loss Functions](https://towardsdatascience.com/machine-learning-fundamentals-via-linear-regression-41a5d11f5220)
