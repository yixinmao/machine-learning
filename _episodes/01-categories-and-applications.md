## 1. Supervised Learning

Supervised learning learns a prediction model from past **input data** and **observed outcomes**, such that the prediction can take new input data and estimate outcome.

- **Sub-categories of supervised learning**:

    - **Regression**: outcomes are *continuous* values

        - Example applications:

            - Predict housing price given house size, location, number of rooms and year

            - Predict streamflow in the next week given mean annual streamflow, streamflow in the past week, rainfall in the past week and day of year

    - **Classification**: outcomes are *categorical* values

        - Example applications:

            - Classify handwritten digits

            - Land classification

## 2. Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning groups, interprets and find patterns in input data *without outcome data*. For example, unsupervised learning can be applied to identify groups (or **clusters**) in the data.
